# Image style transfer
This is an implementation of image style transfer by using CNN with Tensorflow.

The system extract content and style from an image and combined them together in order to get an artistic image by using neural network. The code written in python3 with PyQt5 for the Gui and worked on pre-trained network with tensorflow.

This is a collage project that based on J. Johnson paper and Leon A. Gatys paper, you can find our full project paper in the following link:


For using the application you can or downlowd stylemaker.exe and run it on any machine, or run the python code on python3 environment.
